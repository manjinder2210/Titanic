We have a Titanic Dataset from Kaggle . We first permormed some Data Manipulation by checking and filling out the missing values . 
We then ran Chi Square Test on Categorical Variables to determine if there is any association between different categorical variables
and then plotted them on different kinds of graph to visualize it from different aspects .
